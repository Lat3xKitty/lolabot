## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
LolaBot was developed by a camgirl who was looking for a way to control her lovense toys in her discord server. 
<br>LolaBot is contolled by text commands (example: !lushhigh) that activate the toys via the discord bot.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
### Installing <a name = "installing"></a>

Install node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/

You will need to download the source code from GitHub, then open a powershell window (Shift+LeftClick) in the LolaBot main folder.
<br>

<br>

In that powershell window, download discord js by typing 'npm install discord.js' then hitting enter:<br>

```
npm install discord.js

```

Do the same for node-fetch by typing 'npm install node-fetch' and hitting enter<br>

```
npm install node-fetch

```

## üöÄ Deploying your own bot <a name = "deployment"></a>
Log onto the Discord Developer Portal: (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.<br>

![working](https://imgur.com/JS4TdZK.png)<br>

Set your photo, name your bot, add a description.<br> 
Select "Bot" on the side panel, under settings.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/Etzf6RF.png)<br>
Click to find your token, copy this and add it to the file config.json that you downloaded.<br> 
![working](https://imgur.com/n0drNJW.png)<br>
Replace "YOUR-DISCORD-TOKEN" with the token you copied.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/br2RKT8.png)<br>

Go to OAuth2 on the Discord Developer Portal, located on the side panel under settings.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/pE3KbZv.png)<br>

From here, click the bot square and generate a url. You can also set permissions below, or leave it blank.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/KAIBhsi.png)<br>
Copy this url into your web browser and add the bot to a server you manage<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/GA84dnX.png)<br>

### Config File

Now, it's time to configurate the bot. You've already changed the token, now it's time to imput the parameters to make the APIs work.<br>
Open up the file 'config.json', this is the file we are changing.<br>

Connect your lovense toys to Lovense Connect App for Android. Once connected, copy and paste this link into a web browser: https://api.lovense.com/api/lan/getToys <br>
This returns a string of JSON that contains your domain, httpPort, and toyId. Copy then replace each 'domain' with your domain. Do the same for httpPort and your toyIds. <br>
When complete, each link will have a unique domain, httpPort, and toyId unless you do not own the toy. <br>
Save your config.json file and let's deploy the bot. <br>

### Deploy the Bot

Go to the main file folder that you downloaded from GitHub and reopen your Powershell window (shift+LeftClick) if you have closed it. 

This time, copy and paste the following in powershell:

```
node index.js
```

If done correctly, the bot should say "Ready!". Do not close the powershell window while the bot is operating.<br>
Each time you want to run the bot, you must repeat the 'Deploy the bot' instructions and leave the powershell window open.<br>
