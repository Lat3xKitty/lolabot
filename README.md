## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
LolaBot was developed by a camgirl who was looking for a way to control her lovense toys in her discord server.
<br>LolaBot is contolled by slash commands (example: /high) that activate the toys via the discord bot.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
### Installing <a name = "installing"></a>

1) Install node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/ (I recommend downloading the latest version of v16)

2) Next, You will need to download the source code from GitHub. This can be done either via the Green **Code** Button and clicking Download ZIP, and Extracting the contents where you'd like.

3) Then open a powershell window (Shift+LeftClick) in the LolaBot main folder.
<br>

3) In that powershell window, download all the required packages for this to work. This includes some stuff for Discord and basic Web requests:<br>

```
npm install
```

## üöÄ Deploying your own bot <a name = "deployment"></a>
Log onto the Discord Developer Portal: (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.<br>

![working](https://imgur.com/JS4TdZK.png)<br>

Set your photo, name your bot, add a description.<br>
Select "Bot" on the side panel, under settings.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/Etzf6RF.png)<br>
Click to find your token, copy this and add it to the file config.json that you downloaded.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/n0drNJW.png)<br>
Replace "YOUR-DISCORD-TOKEN" in config.json, with the token you copied.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/br2RKT8.png)<br>

Next find your guild ID, which will also need to be replaced in config.json by:
Turning on developer mode on your Discord client, under Settings/Advanced.

![working](https://imgur.com/vyvqNW3.png)<br>
Once developer mode is on, left click on the server/channel your bot is joining and copy ID (bottom of menu). This is your guild ID.

Go to OAuth2 on the Discord Developer Portal, located on the side panel under settings.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/pE3KbZv.png)<br>

From here, click the bot square and generate a url. You can also set permissions below, or leave it blank.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/KAIBhsi.png)<br>
Copy this url into your web browser and add the bot to a server you manage<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/GA84dnX.png)<br>

Last, find your client ID by left clicking on the bot (once it's added in the previous step), going to 'copy ID' and replace in config.json.

### Deploy the Bot
Deploying the bot will create the commands based upon which toys which are available within the app (even if they're not online). So if you have added more toys to your collection, please re-run this command and it will add them too. 

1) Go to the main file folder that you downloaded from GitHub and reopen your Powershell window (shift+LeftClick) if you have closed it.

	This time, copy and paste the following in powershell:
	```
	npm run deploy
	```
	This should reply with information about your toys and finally end off on: **Successfully registered slash commands.**<br/>
  If this returns **No information found in Lovense Config**, Make sure that your Phone/Desktop App is online and re-try running the deploy script.

2)	Next, deploy the bot with 'node index.js', this will be how you start the bot each time.

	```
	npm run main
	```

	If done correctly, the bot should say "LolaBot 3.0 - Ready to Play!". Do not close the powershell window while the bot is operating.<br>
Each time you want to run the bot, you must repeat the 'Deploy the bot' instructions and leave the powershell window open.<br>
