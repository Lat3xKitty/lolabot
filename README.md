## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
LolaBot was developed by a camgirl who was looking for a way to control her lovense toys in her discord server. 
<br>LolaBot is contolled by slash commands (example: /lushhigh) that activate the toys via the discord bot.

4) Next, download the next three libraries in powershell (this will make deploy-commands.js work) by typing in 'npm install @discordjs/builders @discordjs/rest discord-api-types' then hitting enter: <br>
```
npm install @discordjs/builders @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
```

## üöÄ Deploying your own bot <a name = "deployment"></a>
Log onto the Discord Developer Portal: (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.<br>

![working](https://imgur.com/JS4TdZK.png)<br>

Set your photo, name your bot, add a description.<br> 
Select "Bot" on the side panel, under settings.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/Etzf6RF.png)<br>
Click to find your token, copy this and add it to the file config.json that you downloaded.<br> 
![working](https://imgur.com/n0drNJW.png)<br>
Replace "YOUR-DISCORD-TOKEN" with the token you copied.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/br2RKT8.png)<br>

Go to OAuth2 on the Discord Developer Portal, located on the side panel under settings.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/pE3KbZv.png)<br>

From here, click the bot square and generate a url. You can also set permissions below, or leave it blank.<br>
![working](https://imgur.com/KAIBhsi.png)<br>
Copy this url into your web browser and add the bot to a server you manage<br>

### Config File

Now, it's time to configurate the bot. You've already changed the token, now it's time to input the parameters to make the APIs work.<br>
Open up the file 'config.json', this is the file we are changing.<br>

Connect your lovense toys to Lovense Connect App for Android. Once connected, copy and paste this link into a web browser: https://api.lovense.com/api/lan/getToys <br>
This returns a string of JSON that contains your domain, httpPort, and toyId. Copy then replace each 'domain' with your domain. Do the same for httpsPort and your toyIds. <br>
When complete, each link will have a unique domain, httpsPort, and toyId unless you do not own the toy. <br>
Save your config.json file and let's deploy the bot. <br>

**New**: If you would like to connect your toys via the lovense usb dongle for PC, you need to edit the API links in the config file. Remove the "A" before Vibrate/Rotate in each link in the config file. When you are done each link should look like: 

```
https://{domain}:{httpsPort}/Vibrate?v=speed&t=toyId or https://{domain}:{httpsPort}/RotateClockwise?v=speed&t=toyId
```
### Deploy the Bot

1) Go to the main file folder that you downloaded from GitHub and reopen your Powershell window (shift+LeftClick) if you have closed it. 

	This time, copy and paste the following in powershell:
	```
	node deploy-commands.js
	```
	This should reply with 'Successfully registered slash commands.' This will need to be repeated each time the 			deploy-commands.js file is changed to add/remove commands. 

2)	Next, deploy the bot with 'node index.js', this will be how you start the bot each time. 

	```
	node index.js
	```

	If done correctly, the bot should say "LolaBot 3.0 - Ready to Play!". Do not close the powershell window while the bot is operating.<br>
Each time you want to run the bot, you must repeat the 'Deploy the bot' instructions and leave the powershell window open.<br>
